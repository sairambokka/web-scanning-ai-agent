cp .env.example .env
```

4. Configure your `.env` file:
```env
EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_nvidia_api_key_here  # NVIDIA API key from build.nvidia.com
CHROMEDRIVER_PATH=/path/to/your/chromedriver
CHROME_BINARY_PATH=/path/to/your/chrome/binary
```

### Usage

Run the security scanner:
```bash
python main.py
```

Enter the target URL when prompted, and the system will:
1. Perform automated browser testing
2. Capture network logs and DOM data
3. Deploy AI agents for comprehensive analysis
4. Generate detailed security reports

## üìä Analysis Categories

### Frontend Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) prevention
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
- Security headers configuration
- JavaScript security assessment
- File upload security
- Form validation

### Network Security
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Data encryption (in transit and at rest)
- Session management
- Security headers analysis
- Access control evaluation
- API security assessment
- TLS/SSL configuration
- Vulnerability management

### Special Checks
- `/robots.txt` exposure analysis
- `/.well-known/security.txt` compliance
- Third-party script security
- Mixed content detection
- Certificate validation
- Cookie security flags

## üìã Sample Output

```
Vulnerability Report: Example Website

Introduction
This report presents security vulnerabilities identified through automated testing and AI analysis.

Vulnerabilities Found
1. Missing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
2. Insecure session cookie configuration
3. Absence of X-Frame-Options header
4. Potential XSS vulnerabilities in user input fields
5. Missing HSTS header implementation

Steps to solve the vulnerabilities
1. Implement strict CSP headers with nonce-based script execution
2. Configure cookies with HttpOnly and Secure flags
3. Add X-Frame-Options: DENY header
4. Implement input validation and output encoding
5. Enable HSTS with appropriate max-age directive

In conclusion
The website requires immediate attention to critical security headers and input validation mechanisms.

Note
Regular security assessments and automated testing should be implemented as part of the development lifecycle.

## üîß Configuration

### Browser Setup

The system supports both Chrome and Brave browsers. Update the `chrome_binary_path` in `utils.py`:

```python
chrome_binary_path = "/Applications/Brave Browser.app/Contents/MacOS/Brave Browser"
```

### Agent Configuration

Customize agent behavior by modifying the `SecurityAnalysisAgents` class in `helpers.py`. The agents use NVIDIA's language models via ChatNVIDIA:

```python
def frontend_security_agent(self):
    return Agent(
        role='Frontend security Analyst',
        goal='Check for security breaches on the front end',
        tools=ExaSearchTool.tools(),
        llm=self.llama3,  # Uses NVIDIA API via ChatNVIDIA
        backstory=dedent("""\
            Custom backstory for specialized analysis...
        """),
        verbose=True
    )
```

**Note**: The NVIDIA API key should be set as `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment variables for compatibility with the ChatNVIDIA integration.
